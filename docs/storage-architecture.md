# Storage Architecture

This document is the rule for where any piece of data the app persists should live. When adding a new data kind — a new Blizzard response you fetch, a new per-user setting, a new cache — start here. When reviewing a change that touches storage, measure it against the decision flow below.

## The rule

| Kind | Store | Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Static Blizzard reference data** (journal-instance, playable-specialization, playable-class, playable-race, hero-talent-tree — same shape for every user) | **Blob** | `lfmstore/wow/reference/{kind}/{id}.json` + `reference/{kind}/index.json` manifest |
| **Dynamic per-user / per-guild / per-run data** (raider profiles, run signups, guild docs, admin overrides) | **Cosmos** | `lfm-cosmos/lfm/{raiders,runs,guilds}` |
| **Per-entity caches of Blizzard responses** (one user's account profile, one guild's roster) | **Cosmos, embedded** | inside the owning raider/guild document, with a `*FetchedAt` timestamp |
| **Operational bytes** (ASP.NET Data Protection keys, Functions runtime state, deploy zip artifacts) | **Blob** | `lfmstore/{dataprotection,deployments,azure-webjobs-hosts,azure-webjobs-secrets}` |
| **Secrets** (OAuth client secret, DP wrapping key) | **Key Vault** | referenced from App Settings via Key Vault references |
| **Image bytes** | **Not cached by us** | browser HTTP cache + Blizzard render CDN (`render.worldofwarcraft.com`) |

## Why the split

- **Cost.** The Cosmos account is on free tier: 1000 RU/s + 25 GB, shared across every container in the account. Every full-scan `SELECT FROM c` on reference data competes with point-reads on `runs` and `raiders`. Reference data changes on patch days; reading it from Cosmos would consume RU forever for data that doesn't vary per user. Blob reads of ~5 MB of JSON across ~250 files run at effectively $0 for this project's scale.
- **Cold-boot independence.** The blob store is ingested from Blizzard on a weekly timer (`WowReferenceRefreshTimerFunction`) and on admin demand (`POST /api/wow/reference/refresh`). If Blizzard's Game Data API is down, `/api/wow/reference/instances` and `/api/wow/reference/specializations` still serve the last-known good data from blob. Cosmos-sourced reference data would need to be re-populated from Blizzard at deploy time to exist at all.
- **Mental model.** `raiders`, `runs`, `guilds` are "things that change because a user did something". Everything in `wow/reference/` changes only because Blizzard shipped a patch. Keeping those two lifecycles in separate stores makes backup, retention, and reasoning obvious.
- **Converter placement.** Blizzard's no-locale responses store names as localized objects (`{"en_US": "…", "de_DE": "…", …}`). `Lfm.Api.Serialization.LocalizedStringConverter` handles that shape. It belongs on the *Blizzard-shape* records (`BlizzardJournalInstanceDetail.Name`, etc.) that we deserialize from blob, not on our own DTOs. Keeping reference data in blob keeps the converter on the exact types that need it.

## Image caching policy

We cache Blizzard CDN **URLs**, not image bytes. Rationale:

- Blizzard render URLs are content-addressed (the path includes an asset hash), so the browser's HTTP cache works correctly across visits — a repeat viewer gets the image from their disk, not the network. That's the byte cache.
- A second byte cache on our side would add egress cost per image load and a staleness window when Blizzard updates art, for zero user-visible win at our scale.
- The SWA CSP already allows `img-src 'self' https://render.worldofwarcraft.com …`, so the `<img>` tag loads directly from the Blizzard CDN.

A URL is a string. It lives next to the other fields of whatever record needs it:

- Spec icons: `reference/playable-specialization-media/{id}.json` → surfaced as `SpecializationDto.IconUrl` via the spec list endpoint's manifest.
- Instance portraits: `reference/journal-instance-media/{id}.json` → surfaced as `InstanceDto.PortraitUrl`.
- Character portraits: `raiders.PortraitCache` (Cosmos map of `{region-realm-name → render URL}` inside the owner's doc — not shared, not reference data, stays per-user).

If we ever need byte caching (Blizzard CDN reliability changes our mind, offline PWA support, etc.), the escape hatch is a new `lfmstore/media-cache/{kind}/{id}.{ext}` container, populated by the ingester during the weekly refresh. Not done today.

## Decision flow for a new data kind

```
1. Is it a function of one user / one guild / one run?
   yes → Cosmos, in the owning doc (raiders / runs / guilds)
   no  → continue

2. Is it a verbatim Blizzard reference response, same shape for every user?
   yes → Blob, under wow/reference/{kind}/
   no  → continue

3. Is it binary we produce or consume (zip, image we've chosen to cache, pre-built report)?
   yes → Blob, in a purpose-named container
   no  → continue

4. Is it a short-lived cache of a Blizzard call for one specific user?
   yes → embed inside that user's Cosmos doc with a *FetchedAt timestamp.
         Don't introduce a separate cache store.
   no  → continue

5. Still unclear?
   default: blob for reference-shaped data, Cosmos for anything with
   per-entity lifecycle. Write the trade-off down in this file.
```

## Index manifest convention

For every reference kind that has a list endpoint, the ingester emits `reference/{kind}/index.json` carrying every field the list endpoint needs. The read path is one blob GET per list call — not one listing call plus N detail reads. Shape (conceptual):

```json
// reference/playable-specialization/index.json
[
  { "id": 62, "name": "Arcane", "classId": 8, "role": "RANGED_DPS",
    "iconUrl": "https://render.worldofwarcraft.com/.../arcane.jpg" },
  ...
]

// reference/journal-instance/index.json
[
  { "id": 1200, "name": "Liberation of Undermine",
    "modes": [ { "modeKey": "NORMAL:25" }, { "modeKey": "HEROIC:25" } ],
    "expansion": "The War Within",
    "portraitUrl": "https://render.worldofwarcraft.com/.../tile.jpg" },
  ...
]
```

The per-id detail blobs (`{kind}/{id}.json`, `{kind}-media/{id}.json`) stay for future endpoints (detail pages, hero talents) and as the source of truth the manifest is derived from.

## Known exceptions to flag

These look like they violate the rule but don't, because they are per-entity *caches* of Blizzard responses, not shared reference data. They stay embedded in the owning Cosmos document:

- `raiders.PortraitCache` — map of `characterId → render URL`, refreshed by the portrait-fetch flow, tied to the raider doc's TTL.
- `raiders.AccountProfileSummary` — cached Blizzard WoW account profile, tracked by `AccountProfileFetchedAt`.
- `raiders.Characters[*].MediaSummary` — cached Blizzard character media, tracked by `MediaFetchedAt`.
- `guilds.BlizzardRosterRaw` + `guilds.BlizzardProfileRaw` — cached Blizzard guild roster + profile, tracked by `BlizzardRosterFetchedAt` / `BlizzardProfileFetchedAt`.

Splitting any of these out to blob would add round-trips and a consistency surface for zero cost win, because each cache's lifecycle is *the owner's* lifecycle, not a shared patch-day lifecycle.
